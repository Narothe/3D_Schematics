Model tested. Comments:
- Some wires may be too large for this organizer. I recommend then to use sandpaper and grind the side surface of the balls, so that the wire enters without problems
- Sometimes it can also happen that the cable is too small. I recommend then to wrap the part of the cable that will be in contact with the balls with tape (preferably insulating).
- You can stick double-sided tape or foam double-sided tape underneath. You can also screw small screws into the current holes (I have not tested this)
