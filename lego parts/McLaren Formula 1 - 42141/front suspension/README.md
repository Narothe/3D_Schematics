## Version 1.0:
Created 4 parts. The idea is to connect the parts with a 6mm threaded screw on both sides at size 3,9mm. The angles of the elements are 45 degrees.

## Version 1.1:
Rejected one part, 3 remain. The idea to connect parts is this same. Parts 2 and 3 change from 45 degrees to 65 degrees. Correction of circular lego input. Part 1 length reduced by more than 20mm.

## Version 1.2:
Lots of changes. Rearranging the tips at 65 degrees but in a sharper direction. The final version of the files uses: <br>
part1 from version 1.2, <br>
part2 from version 1.0, <br>
part3 from version 1.1. <br>
This arrangement makes the front suspension look good and holds.

## Pre-Version 1.3:
The crossover output from part2 needs to be a little longer. The entire constring needs to be taller.
