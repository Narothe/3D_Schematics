## Version 1.0:
Created 3 parts. The idea is to connect the parts with a 6mm long threaded screw at size 3,9mm and 2mm.

## Version 1.1:
Correction of parts 1, 2, 3 - unification of the screw input to 6mm long and size 3,9mm. Correction of part 1, 2: better fit of the cross-bolt input.

## Pre-Version 1.2:
Use of bolt caps to add spacing (currently does not require the creation of new elements).
